htpp:

Request/responce: (Client-server model)There are client which are browsers which are used to get any type of info we need from a server.
Client it is kinda a person that is going to kithech to get a food, meanwhile kitchen is a Responce to your request, which is giving you what you want.

Htpp is stateless, it is when client and server is know each other only during the current request...if they want againg to communicate they need send reqeust to each other.

Method get: it is simple when we type in a browser adress where we want to jump or by clicking on hyperlinks we can move from one page to another.


Get:  Need just transfer a data with filters, but if we want to send smth secure or with big volume of info, it is better to use Post:
When we have method: Get, adress panel in a browsers will be changed, but in Post method adress panel will be unchanged

POST;  ne prosto vzya i zaqruzil, a on poslal zapros v Server, server vozvrawaet resultat, a browser obrabotal...koqda mi najimaem na SEND v POST methode, on prosit ctob server prinyal etu infu i zaqruzil na server, a potom mi poluchaet otvet

Difference with Get and Post, if we send this link to another user, tht user will be able to get the same page like a previous one only withing GET, but not in a POST
